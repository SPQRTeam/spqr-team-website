"Self-supervised Feature Extraction for Enhanced Ball Detection on Soccer Robots",2025,"C. Lin, D. Affinita, M. Zimmatore, D. Nardi, D. D. Bloisi, V. Suriani","Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks -- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting faster convergence.",BallDetection.png,RoboCup Symposium Best Paper Award 2025,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16821,
"LLCoach: Generating Robot Soccer Behaviors using Multi-Role Large Language Models",2024,"M. Brienza, E. Musumeci, V. Suriani, D. Affinita, A. Pennisi, D. Nardi, D. D. Bloisi","The deployment of robots into human scenarios necessitates advanced planning strategies, particularly when we ask robots to operate in dynamic, unstructured environments. RoboCup offers the chance to deploy robots in one of those scenarios, a human-shaped game represented by a soccer match. In such scenarios, robots must operate using predefined behaviors that can fail in unpredictable conditions. This paper introduces a novel application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the challenge of generating actionable plans in such settings, specifically within the context of the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) competitions where robots are required to autonomously execute soccer strategies that emerge from the interactions of individual agents. In particular, we propose a multi-role approach leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate and refine plans for a robotic soccer team. The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated through an experimental evaluation, which has been carried out by simulating multiple matches where robots with the AI-generated plans play against robots running human built code.",LLCoach.png,,https://www.publicationsgate.net/publication/381736894_LLCoach_Generating_Robot_Soccer_Plans_using_Multi-Role_Large_Language_Models,https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/llcoach/
"Structural Pruning for Multi-Object Detection on NAO Robots",2023,"G. Specchi, V. Suriani, M. Brienza, F. Laus, F. Maiorana, A. Pennisi, D. Nardi, D. D. Bloisi","In this paper, we propose a real-time multi-class detection system for the NAO V6 robot in the context of RoboCup SPL (Stan- dard Platform League) using state-of-the-art structural pruning tech- niques on neural networks derived from YOLOv7-tiny. Our approach combines structural pruning and fine-tuning, to obtain a pruned network that maintains high accuracy while reducing the number of parameters and the computational complexity of the network. The system is capa- ble of detecting various objects, including the ball, goalposts, and other robots, using the cameras of the robot. The goal has been to guarantee high speed and accuracy trade-offs suitable for the limited computa- tional resources of the NAO robot. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system can run in real-time on the NAO robot with a frame rate of 32 frames per second on 224 Ã—224 input images, which is sufficient for soccer competitions. Our results show that our pruned networks achieve comparable accuracy to the original network while significantly reducing the computational complexity and memory requirements. We release our annotated dataset, which consists of over 4000 images of various objects in the RoboCup SPL soccer field.",StructuralPruning.png,,https://www.publicationsgate.net/publication/375380980_Structural_Pruning_for_Real-Time_Multi-Object_Detection_on_NAO_Robots,https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/spqr-multi-object-ssd-pruning
"Play Everywhere: A Temporal Logic based Game Environment Independent Approach for Playing",2023,"V.Suriani, E. Musumeci, D. Nardi, D. D. Bloisi","Robots playing soccer often rely on hard-coded behaviors that struggle to generalize when the game environment change. In this paper, we propose a temporal logic based approach that allows robots' behaviors and goals to adapt to the semantics of the environment. In particular, we present a hierarchical representation of soccer in which the robot selects the level of operation based on the perceived semantic characteristics of the environment, thus modifying dynamically the set of rules and goals to apply. The proposed approach enables the robot to op- erate in unstructured environments, just as it happens when humans go from soccer played on an official field to soccer played on a street. Three different use cases set in different scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",PlayEverywhere.png,RoboCup Symposium Best Paper Award 2023,https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12628,https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/play-everywhere
