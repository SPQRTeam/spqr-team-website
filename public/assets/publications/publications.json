    "abstract": "Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks -- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting faster convergence."

    "abstract": "The deployment of robots into human scenarios necessitates advanced planning strategies, particularly when we ask robots to operate in dynamic, unstructured environments. RoboCup offers the chance to deploy robots in one of those scenarios, a human-shaped game represented by a soccer match. In such scenarios, robots must operate using predefined behaviors that can fail in unpredictable conditions. This paper introduces a novel application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the challenge of generating actionable plans in such settings, specifically within the context of the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) competitions where robots are required to autonomously execute soccer strategies that emerge from the interactions of individual agents. In particular, we propose a multi-role approach leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate and refine plans for a robotic soccer team. The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated through an experimental evaluation, which has been carried out by simulating multiple matches where robots with the AI-generated plans play against robots running human built code."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a real-time multi-class detection system for the NAO V6 robot in the context of RoboCup SPL (Stan- dard Platform League) using state-of-the-art structural pruning tech- niques on neural networks derived from YOLOv7-tiny. Our approach combines structural pruning and fine-tuning, to obtain a pruned network that maintains high accuracy while reducing the number of parameters and the computational complexity of the network. The system is capa- ble of detecting various objects, including the ball, goalposts, and other robots, using the cameras of the robot. The goal has been to guarantee high speed and accuracy trade-offs suitable for the limited computa- tional resources of the NAO robot. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system can run in real-time on the NAO robot with a frame rate of 32 frames per second on 224 ×224 input images, which is sufficient for soccer competitions. Our results show that our pruned networks achieve comparable accuracy to the original network while significantly reducing the computational complexity and memory requirements. We release our annotated dataset, which consists of over 4000 images of various objects in the RoboCup SPL soccer field."

    "abstract": "Robots playing soccer often rely on hard-coded behaviors that struggle to generalize when the game environment change. In this paper, we propose a temporal logic based approach that allows robots' behaviors and goals to adapt to the semantics of the environment. In particular, we present a hierarchical representation of soccer in which the robot selects the level of operation based on the perceived semantic characteristics of the environment, thus modifying dynamically the set of rules and goals to apply. The proposed approach enables the robot to op- erate in unstructured environments, just as it happens when humans go from soccer played on an official field to soccer played on a street. Three different use cases set in different scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Audience interaction provides a consistent impact on the athletes' performance. The analysis of the crowd noise can provide a global indication on the ongoing game situation, less conditioned by subjective factors that can influence a single fan. In this work, we exploit the collective intelligence of the audience of a robot soccer match to improve the performance of the robot players. In particular, audio features extracted from the crowd noise are used in a Reinforcement Learning process to possibly modify the game strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by experiments on registered crowd noise samples from several past RoboCup SPL matches."

    "abstract": "In multi-robot reinforcement learning the goal is to enable a team of robots to learn a coordinated behavior from direct interaction with the environment. Here, we provide a comparison of the two main approaches to tackle this challenge, namely independent learners (IL) and joint-action learners (JAL). IL is suitable for highly scalable domains, but it faces non-stationarity issues. Whereas, JAL overcomes non-stationarity and can generate highly coordinated behaviors, but it presents scalability issues due to the increased size of the search space. We implement and evaluate these methods in a new multi-robot cooperative and adversarial soccer scenario, called 2 versus 2 free-kick task, where scalability issues affecting JAL are less relevant given the small number of learners. In this work, we implement and deploy these methodologies on a team of simulated NAO humanoid robots. We describe the implementation details of our scenario and show that both approaches are able to achieve satisfying solutions. Notably, we observe joint-action learners to have a better performance than independent learners in terms of success rate and quality of the learned policies. Finally, we discuss the results and provide conclusions based on our findings."

Our survey of the vast literature on the subject highlights two directions to further improve the performance of a multi-robot team. In particular, in a dynamic environment, coordination needs to be adapted to the different situations at hand (for example, when there is a dramatic loss of performance due to unreliable communication network). To this end, we contribute a novel approach for coordinating robots. Such an approach allows a robotic team to exploit environmental knowledge to adapt to various circumstances encountered, enhancing its overall performance. This result is achieved by dynamically adapting the underlying task assignment and distributed world representation, based on the current state of the environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our coordination system by applying it to the problem of locating a moving, non-adversarial target. In particular, we report on experiments carried out with a team of humanoid robots in a soccer scenario and a team of mobile bases in an office environment."

    "abstract": "RoboCup soccer competitions are considered among the most challenging multi-robot adversarial environments, due to their high dynamism and the partial observability of the environment. In this paper we introduce a method based on a combination of Monte Carlo search and data aggregation (MCSDA) to adapt discrete-action soccer policies for a defender robot to the strategy of the opponent team. By exploiting a simple representation of the domain, a supervised learning algorithm is trained over an initial collection of data consisting of several simulations of human expert policies. Monte Carlo policy rollouts are then generated and aggregated to previous data to improve the learned policy over multiple epochs and games. The proposed approach has been extensively tested both on a soccer-dedicated simulator and on real robots. Using this method, our learning robot soccer team achieves an improvement in ball interceptions, as well as a reduction in the number of opponents' goals. Together with a better performance, an overall more efficient positioning of the whole team within the field is achieved."

The key contribution of the proposed method consists in exploiting the rules governing the scenario by identifying and using “contexts”. The robots actions and perceptions are specialized to the current context to enhance both single and collective behaviors. The presented approach has been largely validated in a RoboCup scenario.

    "abstract": "In humanoid robotic soccer, many factors, both at low-level (e.g., vision and motion control) and at high-level (e.g., behaviors and game strategies), determine the quality of the robot performance. In particular, the speed of individual robots, the precision of the trajectory, and the stability of the walking gaits, have a high impact on the success of a team. Consequently, humanoid soccer robots require fine tuning, especially for the basic behaviors. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been used to find optimal parameter sets for various humanoid robot behaviors. However, a drawback of learning techniques is time consumption: a practical learning method for robotic applications must be effective with a small amount of data. In this article, we compare two learning methods for humanoid walking gaits based on the Policy Gradient algorithm. We demonstrate that an extension of the classic Policy Gradient algorithm that takes into account parameter relevance allows for better solutions when only a few experiments are available. The results of our experimental work show the effectiveness of the policy gradient learning method, as well as its higher convergence rate, when the relevance of parameters is taken into account during learning."
