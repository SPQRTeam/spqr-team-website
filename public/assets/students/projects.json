        "description": "Previous works have shown that it's possible to generate goalkeeper motion primitives by learning from humans and treating it as a pure reinforcement learning problem. However, this approach can be suboptimal because it doesn't enforce kinematic constraints, only a best-effort behavior. Moreover, a fully learning-based approach doesn't take advantage of prior information, such as the ball's dynamics and its evolution. Combining the strengths of control and reinforcement learning could improve performance, ensure feasible solutions, and enforce intrinsic stability. Finally, a physically-informed learning problem may be more efficient and more stable during the learning phase.",
